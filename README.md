Boolean Space
## prerequest
```
install abc
```
## installation
```
> git clone https://github.com/snoopysfriend/LogicRegression.git
> make
> mv <path of abc> .

```
## how to run
```
> ./lrg-spflip <path-of-io_info.txt> <path-of-iogen> <path-of-circuit.blif>
## this would write the circuit to circuit.blif
> ./test <path-of-io_info.txt> <path-of-iogen> <path-of-circuit.blif>
## this would test the accuracy of the circuit.blif
```
